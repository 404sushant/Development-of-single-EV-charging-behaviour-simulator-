NOTE:
This module implements a theoretical CC–CV charging model based on literature.
It is NOT used in the thesis simulations.

Reason:
The thesis relies on experimentally measured charging power profiles, which
already reflect CC–CV behavior implicitly. Introducing an explicit CC–CV model
would add assumptions not supported by the available data.

Status:
Kept for theoretical reference and potential future work.
