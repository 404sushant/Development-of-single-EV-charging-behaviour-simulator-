#Standby energy consumption at 0 °C and −10 °C was below the resolution of the measurement system and is therefore treated as negligible. At −20 °C, 
# intermittent standby power draw was observed, indicating active cold-soak protection mechanisms, 
# although the overall energy impact remained limited.
